                                <span>Automation - </span>AI makes sense of machines to interpret the situation and take necessary action.
                                Some tasks can be tedious, like checking papers, submitting forms, etc., and these tasks can be automated with the help
                                of AI with minimal human intervention. Employees in an organization/industry can focus on their core responsibility, whereas AI can automate difficult tasks.

                                <span>Speed - </span>AI can do many things without stopping as compared to humans. In addition to automation,
                                AI lets us complete work before the deadline, and work can be done outside working hours, and this reduces not only
                                human labor but also provides great speed and efficiency.

                                <span>Accuracy - </span>AI reduces the chance of error as compared to humans. There are fewer errors because the
                                machine will always act according to the fixed AI algorithm in every scenario. AI helps us define new boundaries of
                                accuracy and precision with less risk.

                                <span>Exploration - </span>Artificial Intelligence has helped us to discover many unexplored places like volcanic sites,
                                ocean floors, etc. Humans cannot visit these vulnerable sites because they cannot survive in those landscapes, and AI
                                machines can visit such sensitive places and collect information.
