                        <p class="iot-section-description">The healthcare devices can directly send the patients’ data health to doctors over a safe network. This allows the doctors to diagnose the patients from remote locations.</p>
                        <h6>Reasons for IoT being beneficial in the healthcare industry are as follows :</h6>
                        <h6>1. Error reduction in treatments</h6>
                        <p class="iot-section-description">
                            With the help of IoT devices, there is a decrease in manual errors in diagnosing patients. Thus, patients can get proper treatment on time. Also, the 24/7 diagnosis through
                            gadgets gives a more clear idea about patients’ health when compared to manual diagnosis.
                        </p>
                        <h6>2. Decrease in the cost of treatments</h6>
                        <p class="iot-section-description">
                            Manual diagnosis requires time and the use of various types of costly equipment, along with other hospital charges. Due to this, the overall cost of the treatment increases.
                            We can reduce these costs by using IoT gadgets. Also, the hospital charges and congestion in hospitals can be reduced as patients can be diagnosed from their respective locations.
                        </p>
                        <h6>3. Availability of specialists in remote locations</h6>
                        <p class="iot-section-description">
                            Internet of Things solves one of the major problems of the healthcare industry that is the availability of doctors, especially specialists, in remote locations.
                            With the help of IoT devices, the treatment of patients in the physical absence of doctors has become possible. The patients just need to wear the device.
                            Then, the device will send all the real-time data of patients’ health to the respective doctors for analyzing the condition. In this way, the scope of
                            Internet of Things is helping the healthcare sector give proper treatment to the needy.

                        <h6>Precision Farming</h6>
                        <p class="iot-section-description">
                            In agriculture, Information and Communication Technology is a tool used for smart farming. With the help of IoT-based devices, crop fields are observed. The technology
                            uses sensors to calculate the moisture of soil, humidity, and temperature. Also, it uses an automated irrigation system to make efficient use of water.
                            Precision farming helps farmers monitor their fields and boost productivity.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Agricultural Drones</h6>
                        <p class="iot-section-description">
                            Drones used for agriculture and farming are one of the best applications of Internet of Things. They are used to enhance agricultural processes. We use agricultural
                            drones for planting crops, irrigating fields, spraying of pesticides, and monitoring the fields. With the help of drones, it becomes easier to evaluate
                            the health of crops. This is all possible with the help of smart IoT-based devices that are used to make agricultural drones.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Smart greenhouses</h6>
                        <p class="iot-section-description">
                            Farmers use greenhouse farming to enhance the productivity of crops. In greenhouse farming, the environmental factors that affect the growth of
                            crops are controlled by manual intervention. However, manually controlling the mechanism for the growth of crops is less productive. The
                            emergence of IoT and technological advancements has led to the creation of IoT-based greenhouses that consist of various devices such as sensors, climate controllers, etc.
